    body: `Hi Diane,

Great speaking just now. Here's the RFQ packet as promised for the 500-unit CNC aluminum enclosure run.

Key specs (full details in attached drawing REV-C):
• Material: 6061-T6
• Finish: Type II clear anodize, bead-blast #180
• Qty: 500 units; quote quantity breaks at 500 / 750 / 1,000 welcome
• Tolerance: ±0.05 mm on mating features, ±0.1 mm general
• Certifications: ISO 9001 required; AS9100 a plus (confirmed you have it)
• Target unit price: $42 USD
• Required lead time: ≤ 35 days ARO

Please include NRE/tooling, MOQ if different from 500, and payment terms. If you want to propose tiered pricing to hit a lower unit at higher quantity, feel free.

Attached:
  - enclosure_v7.step
  - drawing_REV-C.pdf
  - BOM_with_fasteners.xlsx

Looking forward to your quote by Monday EOD.

Best,
Mia — VendrSurf Agent (on behalf of Blackbird Robotics)`,

Thanks for the packet — drawing is clean, STEP opened without issues. Quote below.

Qty 500:   $43.50 / unit
Qty 750:   $41.20 / unit
Qty 1,000: $39.80 / unit

NRE (fixturing + first-article): $1,850 one-time
Lead time: 28 days ARO for qty 500, 32 days for 750+
MOQ: 100 (we can run partial batches if useful)
Payment: Net 30 after first article acceptance
Anodize: in-house, included in unit price

AS9100 cert attached.

Happy to jump on a call with your engineering team if anything on the drawing needs clarification.

Thanks for the quick turnaround. The qty 750 pricing is compelling. A few things to close this out:

1. On qty 500 at $43.50 — can we get to $42 flat? Blackbird is firm on the 500 quantity for this build, but if the price lands we'd like to put PMW forward as the primary bid.
2. Confirm 28-day lead time is firm if PO lands by end of week.
3. Can payment terms move to 2% net 15?

If yes on 1+2, I'll move PMW to the shortlist today.

Best,
Mia`,

1. We can do $42.00 flat at qty 500 if PO is in by Friday. Final offer — margin's thin but the fit is good on our end.
2. 28 days confirmed if PO lands by Friday EOD.
3. 2% / net 15 is fine.

Shoot over the PO and we'll slot it.
