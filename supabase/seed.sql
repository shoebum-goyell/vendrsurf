  'Diane,

Thanks for the quick turnaround. The qty 750 pricing is compelling. A few things to close this out:

1. On qty 500 at $43.50 — can we get to $42 flat? Blackbird is firm on the 500 quantity for this build, but if the price lands we''d like to put PMW forward as the primary bid.
2. Confirm 28-day lead time is firm if PO lands by end of week.
3. Can payment terms move to 2% net 15?

If yes on 1+2, I''ll move PMW to the shortlist today.

Best,
Mia',

1. We can do $42.00 flat at qty 500 if PO is in by Friday. Final offer — margin''s thin but the fit is good on our end.
2. 28 days confirmed if PO lands by Friday EOD.
3. 2% / net 15 is fine.

Shoot over the PO and we''ll slot it.
